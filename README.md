## Introduction

**Care-Path** is a web application designed to help users find healthcare services in their area. It currently focuses on healthcare services in Nigeria, but our goal is to scale up and expand to other countries in the future. With Care-Path, users can easily search for doctors, hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and other healthcare providers near their location, making it convenient to access quality healthcare services.

## Key Features

- **Search Healthcare Services:** Users can search for healthcare services based on their location - country, state, or local government area.
- **Responsive Design:** Care-Path is built with a responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Future Plans

Our vision for Care-Path extends beyond Nigeria. We plan to expand and include healthcare services from other countries to make it a comprehensive global healthcare directory. We aim to provide users worldwide with a reliable and user-friendly platform to find quality healthcare services wherever they are.

Some of our planned future features include:
- **Detailed Provider Information:** Each healthcare provider listing includes detailed information such as contact details, address, working hours, and services offered.
- **User Reviews and Ratings:** Users can read and leave reviews and ratings for healthcare providers, helping others make informed decisions.
- **Save Favorite Providers:** Users can save their favorite healthcare providers for quick access and future reference.
- **Interactive Map:** An interactive map is available to visually locate healthcare providers in the area.
- **International Healthcare Providers:** Incorporate healthcare providers from various countries, ensuring global coverage.
- **Multilingual Support:** Provide support for multiple languages to cater to a diverse user base.
- **Appointment Booking:** Allow users to book appointments directly through the application for added convenience.
